// Primitive data types in Javascript
// There are mainly 7 primitive data types

// 1. Number: Floating point numbers, used for decimals and integers
let age = 23; //number data type
console.log(age);

// 2. String: Sequence of characters, used for text
let firstNamed = 'Abhishek'; // can use either single or double quotes
console.log(firstNamed)

// 3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or falst, used for taking decisions
let fullAge = true;
console.log(fullAge);
console.log(!fullAge);

// 4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
let children;
console.log(children);

// 5. Null: Also means'empty value'

//6. Symbol(ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now]

// 7. BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold

//Note: JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.

//// value has types, NOT variable!!!!
