### Real-Life Analogy (Resturant Example)
Imagine the backend is a resturant kitchen and you are the waiter (frontend).
- 🍽️ GET - "Show me the menu" : <br>
You ask the kitchen: "Can I see what's on the menu?" <br>
The kitchen gives you the information but does not change anything.

- 🧾 POST - "Add a new order" <br>
You give the kitchen a new order: "Here is a new dish to prepare."<br>
Something new is created.

- 🔄 PUT - "Replace the whole order" <br>
You say: "Change my entire order to a pizza instead." <br>
The old order is replaced fully.

- ✏️ PATCH - "Change only one part of my order" <br>
You say: "Keep my dish the same, just make it less spicy."<br>
Only one part is changed.

- ❌ DELETE - "Cancel the order" <br>
You say: "Cancel my dish." <br>
The order is removed completely.
