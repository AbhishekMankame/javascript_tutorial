## RESTN API

### 1. What is a REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for two systems (like frontend and backend) to communicate over the internet using standard rules.

📌 In simple words: A REST API is a set of rules that allows the frontend to talk to the backend using URLs and HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

It uses:

- HTTP methods (GET, POST...)
- URLs
- JSON for sending/receiving data
- Stateless communication (every request is handled independently)
